HOW IT (should) WORK:

1. Create line equation from start point to end point ("journey base")
2. For each polygon, create lines from the center to the vertices ("center lines")
3. Check which center lines the journey base intersects
4. Split the journey base into multiple possible lines going to each vertices' center lines it intersects, to the next
    one, and to the endpoint (Note: make sure these lines don't intersect any center lines, or the machine might try 
    to go through the obstacle)
5. Go through all possible combinations of them to see which has the shortest distance
6. Make the last line of them the new journey base
7. Repeat for all obstacles

NOTICE: HOW TO INPUT DATA
    
    Input ONLY numbers
    Separate by ONE space
    each new string in "args" is a new polygon pas the overall start and end points
    enter said numbers in this order:
    1. x val of overall start point
    2. y val of overall start point
    3. New string in args
    4. x val of overall end point
    5. y val of overall end point
    6. Steps a through c for each polygon
        a. New string in args
        b. x val of one polygon vertice
        c. y val of that same polygon vertice
